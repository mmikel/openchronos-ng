openchronos
===========

Fork of https://github.com/dchaves/openchronos in order to create a working openchronos port for the new version of the watch (white PCB).

Main goal is communications between arduino (+CC1101), raspberry (+CC1101) and chronos.

Compiling and debugging with out-of-box (debian8) msp430 tools and fresh mspdebug.

Also added some new functionalities and bugfixes.
