openchronos-ng - http://openchronos-ng.sourceforge.net

Modular opensource firmware for the TI eZ430 Chronos.
Please check our homepage for the most up to date information.

== Boot Menu & RFBSL (flashing over RF) ==
In openchronos-ng, the watch no longer boots directly into the
main menu anymore. When the watch is reset (or you put the battery
for the first time), you have the choice to either enter flash mode
(press # button) or continue into main menu (press any other button).

== Recommended Toolchain ==

We recommend you to use the following versions for your toolchain,
since certain version combinations can result in buggy code!

msp430-gcc-4.6.3_p20120406
msp430-libc-20120716
msp430mcu-20120716

and for debugging:
